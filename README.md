#                  So Far   

######  Prints PID and Process names that are not in whitelist ###### 

######  Kills Processes in Blacklist ###### 

######  Edit whitelist and blacklist .json files in settings folder to add files to blacklist and whitelist ###### 

###### The script should  read from /Settings .json files to fill in the whitelist and blacklist ###### 

######  Runs every 60sec until you stop it. ###### 

###### 60 sec. <- should be changed when GUI is ready to be in a /Settings.json file with other information that should be kept between sessions. ###### 


#   To DO   

######  make it so you can start or stop the script from running from said GUI ###### 

######  GUI should have buttons to easy put process into Blacklist or Whitelist. ###### 

######  maybe a counter/grap about wich processes have been killed, how many times etc. and the times it got killed. ######
